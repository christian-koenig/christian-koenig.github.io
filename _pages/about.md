# Christian König
## Postdoctoral Researcher of Quantitative Sociology

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the WZB research unit on [Skill Formation and Labor Markets](https://wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-social-inequalities/skill-formation-and-labor-markets), where I work in the EU Horizon Europe project "Mapping inequalities through the life course" ([Mapineq](https://mapineq.eu/)), and a guest researcher at the WZB [Health and Social Inequality](https://wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-social-inequalities/health-and-social-inequality) research group. My research interests lie primarily in socio-spatial inequalities with a particular focus on neighborhood environments, housing, health, education, and labor market attainment.
