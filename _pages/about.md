# Hi there

My name is Christian and I am a quantitative sociologist with a background in economics and political science researching social inequalities in housing, health, education, and labor market attainment. My research agenda centers particularly on the **socio-spatial dimension of causes, patterns, and consequences of inequalities**.
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the WZB research unit on Skill Formation and Labor Markets, where I work in the EU Horizon Europe project "Mapping inequalities through the life course" (*Mapineq*), and a guest researcher at the WZB Health and Social Inequality research group.
