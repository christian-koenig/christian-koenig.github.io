# Christian KÃ¶nig
## Postdoctoral Researcher of Quantitative Sociology

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en/persons/christian-konig). My primary research interests lie in socio-spatial inequalities, particularly in the areas of neighborhood environments, housing, health, education, and labor market attainment.
